# vim-crystal

This was originally a fork of [vim-crystal/vim-crystal](https://github.com/vim-crystal/vim-crystal) that discarded many of the original's features in order to study how syntax highlighting and indentation could be made faster and more accurate. I have decided to move it to a separate repository for anyone who wants a faster, lightweight alternative to the original vim-crystal.
