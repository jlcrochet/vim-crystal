# vim-crystal

This was originally a fork of [vim-crystal/vim-crystal](https://github.com/vim-crystal/vim-crystal) that discarded many of the original's features in order to focus on improving the speed and accuracy of syntax highlighting and indentation while covering the most common edge cases. I have decided to move it to a separate repository for anyone who wants a faster, lightweight alternative to the original vim-crystal.
